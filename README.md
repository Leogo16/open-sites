# Python Website Opener

This simple Python project automatically opens multiple websites listed in a text file (Sites.txt) using your default web browser.

## How It Works  
When you run the script, it reads all the URLs stored in Sites.txt and opens each one in a new browser tab on your computer.

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x installed
- A file named Sites.txt in the same directory as the script (Each line in Sites.txt should contain one website link, for example: https://www.google.com)

## Usage  
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Add your desired websites inside Sites.txt.
3. Run the script in your terminal:
   python3 main.py
4. The listed websites will open automatically in your default browser.

## Example  
If Sites.txt contains:
https://www.google.com
https://www.youtube.com
https://github.com
Running the script will open all three websites in separate tabs.
